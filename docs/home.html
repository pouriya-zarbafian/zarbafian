        <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Sydney under the supervision of Vincent Gramoli in the <a href="https://gramoli.github.io/csrg/" target="_blank">Concurrent Systems Research Group</a>. 
            My research focuses on the security and the scalability of blockchains, and on a fair ordering of transactions.
            Previously I worked as a software engineer specialized in enterprise applications for governmental institutions, financial actors, and aviation.
